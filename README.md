# Marketing and Profitability Dashboard Analysis

The goal is to derive actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies, focusing on profitable products and regions, and understanding seasonality patterns in sales and profitability.

The dashboard answers the following key business questions:
- Which products should we focus on?
- Which regions are driving the most profitability?
- Where are our marketing efforts most effective?
- Which products need more marketing focus?
- What are the trends and seasonality patterns in sales and profit?
